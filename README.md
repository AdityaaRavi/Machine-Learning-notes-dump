# Machine-Learning-notes-dump
I am learning ML using Kaggle Tutorials... This repo is where all my notes are.

Feel free to use them for your prepartion too! Look at the first line in each of the markdown documents for a link to the kaggle course which was used as a basis to build that.

As of now, this repo has:

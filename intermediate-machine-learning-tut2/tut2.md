# Intermediate Machine Learning
Based on the Kaggle Tutorial ("Intermediate Machine Learning")[https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning] by Alexis Cook.

## 1. Introduction
**Goals:**
- tackle data types often found in real-world datasets (missing values, categorical variables),
- design pipelines to improve the quality of your machine learning code,
- use advanced techniques for model validation (cross-validation),
- build state-of-the-art models that are widely used to win Kaggle competitions (XGBoost), and
- avoid common and important data science mistakes (leakage).

**Competition submission steps reiterated:**
1. save version with the `Save and Run all` version enabled.
2. once that is done, click on the number right next to the `Save Version` button.
3. This pulls up a list of versions on the right of the screen. Click on the ellipsis (...) to the right of the most recent version, and select     Open in Viewer. 
4. This brings you into view mode of the same page. You will need to scroll down to get back to these instructions.
